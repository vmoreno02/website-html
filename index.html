        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Victoria Moreno and I am a junior at Brigham Young University.
          As a computer science major, I have coded in (and cried about) C, C++, 
          Python, and Java. I've done work for both front end and back end, and I 
          have experience with both object-oriented programming (software developement
          and UI) and competitive programming. I'm currently taking CS 260 (web developement 
          with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript), CS 393 (competitive programming and interviews), 
          and CS 240 (software development and design patterns). I don't know exactly what 
          I want to do with my degree, but I'm leaning towards full stack, back-end software 
          developer, or web developer. UI alone isn't for me.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I'm not coding, I like to draw, play the piano, do creative writing, 
          bother my family for pictures of my two cats in Arizona, and watch anime 
          with my friends. I'm a member of BYU's origami club, Chinese students and 
          scholars club (my mother is Chinese-American), and competitive programming club.
